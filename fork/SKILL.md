# Fork Conversation

Generate a context handoff for a new Claude session. No tool calls needed - synthesize from memory and output immediately.

## Output Format

```
## Fork Ready

**Context Summary:**
- Working on: [one sentence - current task]
- Files: [comma-separated paths, max 5-7, mention "+ N others" if more]
- State: [key decisions, branch, blockers, test status - bullets if multiple]

**Paste in new terminal:**
```bash
cd [target directory]
claude "/mission-control [escaped prompt here]"
```

*This conversation continues here. The fork runs independently.*
```

## Building the Command

Always invoke `/mission-control` so the forked session starts in coordination mode:

```
/mission-control Context from forked conversation:
- Working on: [description]
- Files: [list]
- Key context: [important decisions, findings, state]

Continue with: [focus hint from args, or "Pick up where we left off"]
```

## Args Handling

- `/fork` - generic continuation, opens in mission-control
- `/fork debug the auth issue` - args become the "Continue with:" line

## Permission Mode Propagation

If the current session has bypass permissions enabled, propagate it to the fork:

```bash
cd [dir]
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "/mission-control ..."
```

Check your current permission context. If you're running with elevated permissions (no confirmation prompts for file edits, bash commands, etc.), include the flag so the forked session has the same capabilities.

## Shell Escaping

- Wrap entire prompt in double quotes
- Escape internal double quotes as `\"`
- Escape dollar signs as `\$`
- Escape backticks as `` \` ``

## What to Include

- Target directory for the forked task (may be current cwd, or different if the tangent involves another repo/location)
- Current task (one sentence)
- Key decisions/findings (not speculation)
- Relevant file paths
- Important state (branch, test status, blockers)

## What NOT to Include

- Full conversation history
- Implementation details already in files
- Secrets or credentials
- Plans not yet acted on
- Tool call history

## Edge Cases

- **Conversation just started**: Minimal fork, note limited context
- **Many files**: Top 5-7 most relevant, note "and N others"
- **Sensitive content**: Omit credentials, note they exist separately

## Anti-patterns

- Multi-paragraph summaries
- Waiting for confirmation
- Suggesting alternatives
- Including noise from tool outputs
