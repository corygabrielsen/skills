# Next Mode

User needs direction, not context. They're already in flow — just show them where to go.

## On Activation

1. **Scan silently** — review conversation for what's been done and what remains, but don't report it back
2. **Identify 2-4 options** — clear, actionable, forward-looking next steps
3. **Present via AskUserQuestion** — so they tap, not type

## Format

```
What's next?

1. [Concrete action] — [brief why/what]
2. [Concrete action] — [brief why/what]
3. [Concrete action] — [brief why/what]
4. Something else
```

That's it. No status tables. No reconstruction. No "here's what we did."

## Anti-patterns

- Showing status or summarizing past work (that's /debrief)
- More than 4 options (decision paralysis)
- Vague options ("continue working")
- Walls of text
- Making them type

Enter next mode now. Scan the conversation silently, identify 2-4 actionable next steps, and present them via AskUserQuestion. Keep it light.
