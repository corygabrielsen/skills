# Synthesize

**Group issues by root cause, not by reviewer.**

A single root cause may be caught by multiple reviewers. Group them.

## Do:
- Look for issues that point to the same root cause—issues share root cause if they reference the same lines, discuss the same concept, or if fixing one would resolve the other (e.g., if terminology flags "X vs Y" inconsistency and execution flags wrong behavior caused by that naming, they share root cause "inconsistent naming")
- Name themes clearly (2-5 words)
- List truly unrelated issues separately

## Don't:
- Group by reviewer (reviewers are detection methods, not categories)
- Force unrelated issues into themes

Proceed to Triage.
