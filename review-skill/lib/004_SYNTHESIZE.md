# Synthesize

**Group issues into themes, not by reviewer.**

## Do:
- Group issues by theme—same lines, same concept, or causal relationship (e.g., terminology flags "X vs Y" and execution flags wrong behavior from that naming → "inconsistent naming")
- Name themes clearly (2-5 words)

## Don't:
- Group by reviewer (reviewers are detection methods, not categories)
- Force unrelated issues into themes

Proceed to Triage.
