# Synthesize

**Group issues into themes, not by reviewer.**

A single theme may be caught by multiple reviewers. Group them.

## Do:
- Look for issues that belong to the same theme—issues share a theme if they reference the same lines, discuss the same concept, or if one directly causes the other (e.g., if terminology flags "X vs Y" inconsistency and execution flags wrong behavior caused by that naming, they share theme "inconsistent naming")
- Name themes clearly (2-5 words)
- List truly unrelated issues separately

## Don't:
- Group by reviewer (reviewers are detection methods, not categories)
- Force unrelated issues into themes

Proceed to Triage.
