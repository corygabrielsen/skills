# Triage

**Propose fixes. Don't edit yet.**

## Do:
- Propose ONE fix per theme
- For each issue, determine resolution type (all edits are to `{target_file}`, the document being reviewed):
  - **Real issue** → propose document change
  - **False positive** → propose clarifying text (comment, note, or rewording that makes intent obvious)
- **IMPORTANT:** For each theme, update its issues to `planned` immediately after proposing the fix (before moving to next theme)

## Don't:
- Make edits during triage
- Dismiss issues as "not actionable"—every flagged issue gets a document change (skip launch failures; they're infrastructure errors)
- Skip minor issues—if flagged, the document needs improvement

Proceed to HIL: Plan Approval.
