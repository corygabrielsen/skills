# Triage

**Propose fixes. Don't edit yet.**

## Do:
- Propose ONE fix per theme
- For each issue, determine resolution type (all edits are to `{target_file}`, the document being reviewed):
  - **Real issue** → propose document change
  - **False positive** → propose clarifying text (comment, note, or rewording that makes intent obvious)
- Immediately after proposing a fix for a theme, update that theme's issues from `open` to `planned`

## Don't:
- Make edits during triage
- Dismiss document issues as "not actionable"—every reviewer-flagged issue gets a document change (launch failures are infrastructure errors, not document issues; skip them in triage)
- Skip issues because they seem minor—if a reviewer flagged it, the document can be clearer

Proceed to HIL: Plan Approval.
