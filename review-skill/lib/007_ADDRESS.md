# Address

**Execute the approved plan.**

## Do:
- Process themes sequentially (avoid line-number shifts). Each theme's fix may require multiple edits. On Edit error: re-read, re-compute line numbers, retry (max 2 retries, 3 total attempts).
- Update tracker status based on resolution type:
  - `planned` → `fixed` (real issue was corrected)
  - `planned` → `clarified` (false positive addressed with clarifying text)
- Use `Edit` tool for edits

## Don't:
- Deviate from approved plan
- Skip any issue
- Leave any issue without a document change

Proceed to Verify.
