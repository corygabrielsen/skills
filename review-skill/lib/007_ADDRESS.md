# Address

**Execute the approved plan.**

## Do:
- Process each theme sequentially (not in parallel, to avoid line-number shifts affecting subsequent edits). Apply the proposed fix for each theme, which may require one or more edits to address all issues within that theme. If an edit fails mid-theme, re-read the file, re-compute line numbers, and retry; do not skip issues.
- Update tracker status based on resolution type:
  - `planned` → `fixed` (real issue was corrected)
  - `planned` → `clarified` (false positive addressed with clarifying text)
- Use `Edit` tool for edits

## Don't:
- Deviate from approved plan
- Skip any issue
- Leave any issue without a document change

Proceed to Verify.
