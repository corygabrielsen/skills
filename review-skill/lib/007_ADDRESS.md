# Address

**Execute the approved plan.**

## Do:
- Process each theme sequentially (not in parallel, to avoid line-number shifts affecting subsequent edits): make one or more edits as needed
- Update tracker status based on resolution type:
  - `planned` → `fixed` (real issue was corrected)
  - `planned` → `clarified` (false positive addressed with clarifying text)
- Use `Edit` tool for changes

## Don't:
- Deviate from approved plan
- Skip any issue
- Leave any issue without a document change

Proceed to Verify.
