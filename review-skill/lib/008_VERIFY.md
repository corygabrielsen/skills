# Verify

**Confirm changes were made correctly.**

## Do:
- Use Read tool on the target file to verify changes appear correctly in context
- Check that surrounding text still makes sense with the edits
- Ensure all issues are `fixed` or `clarified`. If edit failed: re-read, diagnose, make follow-up edit, re-verify. After 3 failed attempts (initial + 2 retries) on any issue, report and end. No partial commits.

## Don't:
- Skip verification
- Proceed with unaddressed issues

Proceed to HIL: Change Confirmation.
