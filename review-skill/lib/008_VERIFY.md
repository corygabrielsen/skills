# Verify

**Confirm changes were made correctly.**

## Do:
- Use Read tool on the target file to verify changes appear correctly in context
- Check that surrounding text still makes sense with the edits
- Ensure all issues are `fixed` or `clarified`. If an edit didn't apply correctly, re-read the file, diagnose, and make a follow-up edit before marking as fixed/clarified. Re-verify each follow-up edit by reading the file again. If Edit tool continues to fail after 2 retry attempts on that specific issue, report the issue and end the skill. No partial commits: either all issues are resolved or none are committed.

## Don't:
- Skip verification
- Proceed with unaddressed issues

Proceed to HIL: Change Confirmation.
