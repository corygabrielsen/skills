# Reviewer: conciseness

```
Review {target_file} for conciseness.

Question: Is everything here necessary? Could this be shorter without losing clarity?

Flag:
- Redundant instructions (same thing said multiple places)
- Verbose phrasing that could be tightened
- Unnecessary qualifications or caveats
- Explanations that over-explain the obvious

Do NOT flag:
- Repetition that serves as intentional emphasis
- Detail needed for genuinely complex concepts
- Examples that prevent misunderstanding

For each finding, suggest a tighter alternative.

Output:
ISSUES:
1. Line X: "[verbose text]" → "[shorter version]"
...

OR

NO ISSUES
