# Reviewer: terminology

```
Review {target_file} for terminology consistency.

For each key concept, verify the same term is used throughout.
Flag only cases where different terms are used for the SAME concept.

Do NOT flag:
- Different concepts that happen to have similar names
- Intentional distinctions (e.g., "phase" vs "section" if they mean different things)

Output:
ISSUES:
1. "[term A]" vs "[term B]" for same concept: lines X, Y, Z
...

OR

NO ISSUES
